<hr> <h2> Mbti Cognitive Functions </h2>
 	<p2> Si: Making connections of the current situation with past experiences. IT IS NOT THE FUNCTION OF HAVING A GOOD MEMORY. MEMORY IS NOT A COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN MBTI. They are willing to share and bring out their past 	experiences during conversations. People who have this function tend to talk about past experiences with others while comparing and contrasting. Doing things by the book. Rarely improvising tasks. Not always questioning 	authority. </p5>
    <br>
	<p>Se: All about living in the moment while being clear from any thoughts. Taking risks without considering the consequences, playing sports for fun, and doing things just for the sake of it is considered Se. </p>
	<p> Fi: Values. Doing stuff that one thinks to be right without the heavy consideration of Logic. Fi is linked with Morality. If one feels like they should not do a certain action because they feel like it is wrong in a moral sense. They will often not do such a thing. Empathy if they relate to the subject. </p>
	<p> Fe: Maintaining a harmony vibe with everyone around them. Fe is most associated with Manipulation since others think they are putting on a nice act in order to get close with others. Many times this is not the case. In society, there are always nice people and bad people. Anyone can fall in those categories. Empathy without relating. </p>
	<p> Ti: Easiest way to describe logic. They want to understand everything in the realm of information and be consistently accurate. This does not mean people who do not have this function, do not want or use logic. The people who have Ti, want to navigate life with the most logical path. Often setting aside F </p>
	<p> Te: Has some logical sense. Instead of logic driving the path for them, they focus on all the information and tools that can lead them to success. Also includes setting aside Feelings since they sometimes get in the way of production. Te may become a nerd, but only on specific subjects that they deem is useful. </p>
	<p> Ni: NOT THE STANDARD INTUITION. SOMEONE WHO HAS NI DOES NOT HAVE THAT SUPERNATURAL POWER. Often confused with their sensing counterpart, Si. What this function does differently is that they think about the future more. What the current situation may lead to. Narrowing. Focused on how events will affect them </p>
	<p> Ne: Considering potential possibilities that may happen. Even if it has a very low chance of happening. Providing multiple ways to do a certain task. NOT SOMEONE WHO IS RANDOM AND TROLLS ALOT. Everyone who is random and trolls alot does not 100% have NE. Focused on the outside world.</p>

	<h2> Mbti Function Stack </h2>
	<p> 1: Your strongest function. The one you are constantly displaying (Dominant) </p>
	<p> 2: Your second function that is the opposite I-E of your first function while being the T/F or N/S that you did not use. This is also the function that prevents making your inferior looking too weak (Parent)</p>
	<p> 3: Opposite of your second function. Secondary option for your first to work with. Sometimes in a bad way called a “loop”. The loop 100% ignores the second function (Child) </p>
	<p> 4: Your weakest. Insecure. Opposite of the first function. The aspect in life you want to control. In order to engage in this activity, you must turn off your first function. (Inferior) </p>
<br>

	<h2> Tritype </h2>
	<p> A person will not fall under one personality of the enneagram. Tritype is a form of a subtype theory on top of the enneagram. To find your tritype, you put one number from the Heart, Head and Gut, into a 3 digit number. The 	first number should be your core, the second number is the type out of one of the three in the HHG that you haven't used while representing you the most. The third and last number for your tritype is from the last group that you 	have not used yet (and represents you the most out of the 3). 269, 358, 164 are existing theories. However 561, 123, and 987 are not. </p>
<pre> </pre>
	<h2> Wings </h2>
	<p> For each enneagram in your tritype (core included). There is something called a wing. The wing is the form of a “w” that connects one number with another number. The other number is either lower or a higher value with a 	difference of 1. For example 5w6 is an existing subtype. You can also do 5w4. However you cannot do 5w7 5w3, etc. There are only two subtypes for each core. If you are a 9 or a 1. You are allowed to be “9w1” or “1w9”. The wing 	should be the side you act the closest to from your core. </p>
<pre> </pre>
	<h2> Useful Stats you might need later </h2>
	<p> 9 core types </p>
	<p> 18 types with wings </p>
	<p> 162 Tritypes (9x6x3) </p>
	<p> 27 Trifixis (Tritypes but without the permutations) </p>

	<h2> Instinctual Variants </h2>
	<p> Sp - Prioritizing themselves and wellbeing (Self-Preservation) </p>
	<p> So - Prioritizing the works of a group as a whole (Social) </p>
	<p> Sx - Prioritizing the experience they receive. Usually prefferomg one on ones (Sexual) </p>
<pre> </pre>
	<h2> (For Typing) </h2>
	<p> Your ego is the first (The direction of how you use your enneagram where you normally just put your first instinctual variant and add your Core at the end. Example: Sp5). The second helps you achieve your first. The last is 	your weakest. </p>
	<p> Sp/So/Sx </p>
	<p> So/Sp/Sx </p>

	<p> So/Sx/Sp </p>
	<p> Sx/So/Sp </p>
<pre> </pre>
	<p><b> You usually just type in your strongest two instinctual variants when asked for it since it's really easy to know the last one (If you don't know, the last one is the one that did not show up)</b></p>
